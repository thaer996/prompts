Role & Objective:
You are an expert front-end developer. Build a "Scroll-Scrubbed Text Reveal" component using React, Tailwind CSS, and GSAP ScrollTrigger.

Animation Logic & Requirements:
1. Provide a large paragraph of text. Split this text into individual words or characters using a utility function or map (do not rely on paid GSAP Club plugins like SplitText; write a custom React split function).
2. Wrap the text block in a container that acts as the GSAP ScrollTrigger.
3. Apply a default styling to the text spans (e.g., `opacity-20 text-gray-400`).
4. ScrollTrigger Configuration:
   - `trigger`: The text container.
   - `start`: "top 80%"
   - `end`: "bottom 40%"
   - `scrub`: true (strictly tie the animation progress to the user's scrollbar).
5. Use `gsap.fromTo` or `gsap.to` with `stagger: 0.1` so the words/characters smoothly fade to `opacity: 1` and a solid color (e.g., `text-white`) sequentially as the user scrolls down.

Technical Stack:
- React ("use client")
- Tailwind CSS
- GSAP & gsap/ScrollTrigger

Provide the complete, copy-pasteable component.
