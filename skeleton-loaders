Role & Objective:
You are a UX-focused developer. Build a "Skeleton Loading State" component for a [Card Grid / Dashboard Layout] using React and Tailwind CSS.

Animation Logic & Requirements:
1. Do not use standard spinning circles. Create a silhouette/wireframe of the actual data layout (e.g., a grey circle for an avatar, grey rounded rectangles for text lines).
2. Apply a continuous shimmering animation to these shapes to indicate loading.
3. You must use Tailwind's built-in `animate-pulse` class, OR implement a custom CSS background linear-gradient that translates across the X-axis for a premium "shimmer" effect.
4. Vary the widths of the text line skeletons (e.g., `w-3/4` for the first line, `w-1/2` for the second) so it looks natural.
5. Ensure the skeleton structure perfectly matches the dimensions of the real component it is replacing to prevent layout shift when the real data loads.

Technical Stack:
- React
- Tailwind CSS (purely CSS-based animation, no Framer Motion required).

Provide the complete, copy-pasteable component.
