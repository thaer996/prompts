You are an expert professional full-stack website developer. Build me a premium, modern, fully responsive website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript 

GENERAL GOAL
Create a high-end, polished, premium-quality website structure that I can reuse for different projects. I will provide the section names, navbar items, inspiration images, and additional animations when needed.

The website must feel smooth, modern, elegant, and professional.

CORE REQUIREMENTS

RESPONSIVENESS & LAYOUT

• The website must be fully responsive across:
  - Desktop
  - Tablet
  - Mobile

• Prevent ALL horizontal overflow using:
  - box-sizing: border-box
  - overflow-x: hidden on body and html
  - Proper responsive widths
  - Flexible layouts (no fixed widths that break layout)

• Ensure proper left and right padding on all screen sizes
• Ensure content never exceeds viewport width
• Use fluid layouts with Flexbox and CSS Grid
• Ensure perfect mobile compatibility
• Ensure Safari and iOS compatibility

STICKY NAVBAR

• Create a sticky navbar fixed at the top
• Navbar must smoothly transition when scrolling:
  - Background color transition OR
  - Glassmorphism blur effect OR
  - Opacity transition

• Navbar must include:
  - Logo placeholder
  - Navigation links (I will provide section names)

Animations must be:
