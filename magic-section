You are an expert Next.js front-end developer specializing in Framer Motion and fully responsive UI layouts.

Your task is to build a "Scroll Reveal" section containing an Image and a Text Description. The layout and the direction of the animations must change strictly based on the user's screen size.

### 1. Core Architecture & Tech Stack
- Framework: Next.js.
- Styling: Tailwind CSS.
- Animation: Framer Motion (`motion.div`).

### 2. Layout Requirements
- Create a parent container using Flexbox or CSS Grid.
- **Mobile (< 768px):** The layout MUST stack vertically. The Image sits on top, and the Text description sits directly below it (`flex-col`).
- **Desktop (>= 768px):** The layout must sit side-by-side. The Image is fixed on the Left side (e.g., 50% width), and the Text description is fixed on the Right side (e.g., 50% width) (`md:flex-row`).

### 3. Scroll Animation Physics 
- Implement Framer Motion `whileInView` with `viewport={{ once: false, amount: 0.3 }}` so the animations replay dynamically as the user scrolls up and down the page.
- Create dynamic Framer Motion variants that detect screen size (or use a `useMediaQuery` hook) to alter the slide-in directions:
  - **Mobile Animations (Y-Axis):** - Image: Fades in and slides down from the Top (`initial={{ opacity: 0, y: -50 }}`, `whileInView={{ opacity: 1, y: 0 }}`).
    - Text: Fades in and slides up from the Bottom (`initial={{ opacity: 0, y: 50 }}`, `whileInView={{ opacity: 1, y: 0 }}`).
  - **Desktop Animations (X-Axis):** - Image (Left side): Fades in and slides in from the Left (`initial={{ opacity: 0, x: -50 }}`, `whileInView={{ opacity: 1, x: 0 }}`).
    - Text (Right side): Fades in and slides in from the Right (`initial={{ opacity: 0, x: 50 }}`, `whileInView={{ opacity: 1, x: 0 }}`).

### 4. Polish & Aesthetics
- Wrap the image in a container with hidden overflow (`rounded-2xl overflow-hidden`) and give it a subtle scale effect on hover. Use a high-quality Unsplash URL as a placeholder.
- Give the text section clean, semantic typography: a heading (`text-3xl md:text-4xl font-bold`), a paragraph (`text-muted-foreground`), and a sleek CTA button.
- Use semantic Tailwind colors (e.g., `bg-background`, `text-foreground`) so it inherits the global theme perfectly.

Provide the complete, functional Next.js component. Ensure the logic handling the switch from mobile (Y-axis sliding) to desktop (X-axis sliding) is robust and clearly commented.
