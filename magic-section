You are an expert Next.js front-end developer specializing in Framer Motion, fully responsive layouts, and RTL (Right-to-Left) language support.

Your task is to build a "Direction-Aware Scroll Reveal" section (Image + Text) that adapts its animation and layout based on both screen size and the HTML `dir` attribute.

### 1. Core Architecture & Tech Stack
- Framework: Next.js.
- Styling: Tailwind CSS.
- Animation: Framer Motion (`motion.div`, `whileInView`).

### 2. Layout & Responsiveness
- Create a container using CSS Grid or Flexbox.
- **Mobile (< 768px):** The layout MUST stack vertically. The Image sits on top, and the Text information sits directly below it. 
- **Desktop (>= 768px):** The layout sits side-by-side (50% Image, 50% Text). 
- Use Tailwind's logical properties (e.g., `gap`, `flex-row`, `flex-row-reverse`) or standard flex layouts so the text and image physically swap sides automatically when the parent HTML has `dir="rtl"`.

### 3. Scroll Animation Physics (The Magic)
- Implement Framer Motion `whileInView` with `viewport={{ once: false, amount: 0.3 }}` so it replays dynamically as the user scrubs up and down the page.
- **Mobile Animations:** - Image: Fades in and slides down from the top (`initial={{ opacity: 0, y: -50 }}`).
  - Text: Fades in and slides up from the bottom (`initial={{ opacity: 0, y: 50 }}`).
- **Desktop Animations (Direction-Aware):** - Read the document direction or pass an `isRTL` boolean prop to the component.
  - *If LTR (English):* Image slides in from the Left (`x: -50`), Text slides in from the Right (`x: 50`).
  - *If RTL (Hebrew/Arabic):* The animation MUST flip. The element on the right side of the screen slides in from the Right (`x: 50`), and the element on the left side slides in from the Left (`x: -50`).

### 4. Polish & Aesthetics
- Wrap the image in a rounded container with hidden overflow (`rounded-2xl overflow-hidden`) and give it a subtle scale effect on hover.
- Give the text section clean, semantic typography (a heading, a paragraph, and a call-to-action button).
- Use semantic Tailwind colors (e.g., `bg-background`, `text-foreground`, `text-muted-foreground`) so it inherits the global theme automatically.

Provide the complete, functional component. Clearly comment the section where the Framer Motion variants handle the Mobile (Y-axis) vs. Desktop (X-axis) and LTR vs. RTL math.
