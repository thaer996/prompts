Role & Objective:
You are an expert GSAP and React developer. Build a "Horizontal Scroll Section" using React, Tailwind CSS, and GSAP ScrollTrigger.

Animation Logic & Requirements:
1. Create a main wrapper section that will be pinned to the screen.
2. Inside the wrapper, create a flex container (`flex-row`, `w-[300vw]` or dynamically sized based on children) holding the horizontal items (e.g., large image cards).
3. Use GSAP `gsap.to()` combined with `ScrollTrigger`.
4. ScrollTrigger Configuration:
   - `trigger`: The main wrapper.
   - `pin`: true (lock the section in the viewport).
   - `scrub`: 1 (smooth scrubbing tied to the scrollbar).
   - `end`: "+=3000" (or a dynamic value based on the total width of the horizontal content to ensure the scroll duration feels natural).
5. The GSAP animation should translate the inner flex container along the X-axis (`xPercent: -100 + (100 / items.length)`) so the user sees all items before the pin releases.

Technical Stack:
- React ("use client")
- Tailwind CSS (overflow-hidden on the outer wrapper is critical)
- GSAP & gsap/ScrollTrigger (use GSAP's `useGSAP` hook for React if possible, or standard `useEffect` with proper cleanup to prevent memory leaks).

Provide the complete, copy-pasteable component.
