=========================================
GLOBAL SPACING & ANTI-DOUBLE-PADDING PROTOCOL
=========================================
You must strictly prevent massive, unnatural gaps (the "Double-Padding Void") between sections. Follow these absolute rules for Vertical Rhythm:

1. The Hero-to-Next-Section Transition (CRITICAL):
   - If the first section (Hero) is full-height (e.g., `min-h-screen` or `h-screen`), it naturally pushes the next section down to the fold.
   - DO NOT apply heavy `pt-` (padding-top) or `mt-` (margin-top) to the section immediately following a full-height Hero.
   - The second section should start with a significantly reduced top padding (or none at all) to maintain a visual connection with the Hero section.

2. Standard Section Spacing (Color-Block Safe):
   - To ensure sections with different background colors touch each other seamlessly, use Padding (`py`), NOT Margin (`my`).
   - Use a strictly controlled fluid clamp for standard sections: `py-[clamp(3rem,5vw,5rem)]`.
   - NEVER use margins (`mt-`, `mb-`) on main `<section>` wrappers. Margins collapse and stack unpredictably. 

3. Section Header vs. Content Proportions:
   - The gap between a section's Title/Header and its inner Grid/Cards MUST be noticeably smaller than the padding between sections.
   - Use Flex/Grid gaps for internal spacing: `flex flex-col gap-[clamp(2rem,4vw,3rem)]` to separate the section header from the content body.

4. Component-Level Spacing:
   - Inside grids or flex rows (e.g., spacing between individual cards or text blocks), use tight, mathematically consistent gaps: `gap-4`, `gap-6`, or `gap-8`.
   - Do not use arbitrary padding inside structural grids unless specifically creating card interiors.

Summary of Visual Hierarchy:
[Gap between Sections] > [Gap between Section Title & Grid] > [Gap between Cards in Grid]
