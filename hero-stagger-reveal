Role & Objective:
You are an expert React animation developer. Build a "Hero Stagger Reveal" section using React, Tailwind CSS, and Framer Motion.

Animation Logic & Requirements:
1. Create a Hero section containing an H1 (Headline), a p tag (Subtitle), and a Button group (CTAs).
2. Utilize Framer Motion's `variants` to create a parent container variant and a child variant.
3. The parent container must trigger a staggered animation on its children (e.g., `staggerChildren: 0.15`).
4. Each child element must start with `opacity: 0` and `y: 20` (pushed down slightly).
5. Each child element must animate to `opacity: 1` and `y: 0` with a smooth spring or ease-out transition.
6. The animation must trigger automatically when the component mounts.

Technical Stack:
- React ("use client")
- Tailwind CSS (for layout and typography styling)
- Framer Motion (variants, motion.div, motion.h1)

Provide the complete, copy-pasteable component.
