Role & Objective:
You are a premium UI developer. Build a "Multi-Layer Parallax Hero Section" using React, Tailwind CSS, and Framer Motion.

Animation Logic & Requirements:
1. Create a Hero section with `position: relative`, `overflow: hidden`, and `height: 100vh`.
2. Include at least 3 distinct layers:
   - Background Layer (e.g., a landscape image or abstract shapes).
   - Midground Layer (e.g., mountains, floating elements, or typography).
   - Foreground Layer (e.g., a subject, product, or bottom gradient overlay).
3. Use Framer Motion's `useScroll` to get the `scrollY`.
4. Use `useTransform` to map the scroll position to different `y` translation values for each layer:
   - Background: moves down slowly (e.g., `useTransform(scrollY, [0, 1000], [0, 300])`).
   - Midground: moves down slightly faster.
   - Foreground: stays relatively static or moves up slightly.
5. Ensure the elements are positioned absolutely on top of each other covering the full screen.

Technical Stack:
- React ("use client")
- Tailwind CSS (absolute positioning, z-index management)
- Framer Motion (useScroll, useTransform, motion.div)

Provide the complete, copy-pasteable component.
