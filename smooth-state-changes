Role & Objective:
You are an expert UI developer. Build a fully animated "Accordion/Expandable FAQ" component using React, Tailwind CSS, and Framer Motion.

Animation Logic & Requirements:
1. The component must map through an array of items (Title and Content).
2. Create a clickable header that toggles the open/closed state. Include a chevron icon that rotates 180 degrees when open.
3. Use Framer Motion's `AnimatePresence` to handle the mounting/unmounting of the content body.
4. The content body must animate its `height` from `0` to `"auto"`, and its `opacity` from `0` to `1`.
5. The transition must be smooth so that content beneath the accordion is pushed down gracefully without any layout snapping.
6. Ensure `overflow: hidden` is applied during the height transition so content doesn't bleed out.

Technical Stack:
- React ("use client", useState)
- Tailwind CSS
- Framer Motion (AnimatePresence, motion.div)
- lucide-react (for the chevron icon)

Provide the complete, copy-pasteable component.
