You are an expert Next.js front-end developer specializing in physics-based UI and 3D web animations.

Your task is to build an "Interactive Infinite Tilted Marquee" component for the personal portfolio website of "THAER SH". The component must feature premium, buttery-smooth physics and a subtle isometric aesthetic.

### 1. Core Architecture & Tech Stack
- Framework: Next.js.
- Styling: Tailwind CSS.
- Animation: You MUST use Framer Motion. 
- Content: Create a row of repeating premium project cards (use placeholder 3D animation project images and tech stack icons relevant to Next.js/Supabase). Duplicate the array seamlessly so it can scroll infinitely.

### 2. The Geometric Tilt (-12 Degrees)
- Wrap the entire carousel in a parent container with `overflow-hidden`.
- Apply exactly `transform: rotate(-12deg)` to the inner carousel track. 
- Ensure the parent container is extra wide (e.g., `120vw` to `150vw`) and repositioned with negative margins so the angled edges span the entire screen, leaving no empty background corners exposed.

### 3. Interactive Physics & Slow Drift
- Implement Framer Motion's `useMotionValue`, `useVelocity`, and `useAnimationFrame` to handle the movement.
- Auto-Scroll Speed: Set the base velocity to `0.5` (or `-0.5`). It should feel like a very slow, ambient, and elegant drift.
- Drag Interactions: Add `drag="x"`. 
- Directional Logic: Track the user's drag direction. If they swipe left, update the direction state so the infinite auto-scroll seamlessly continues to the left. If they swipe right, it must auto-scroll to the right.
- Momentum: When the user releases a drag, use their swipe velocity to temporarily speed up the scroll, then dampen it using a spring animation (`stiffness: 50`, `damping: 20`) until it smoothly settles back down to the `0.5` base velocity.

### 4. Polish & Aesthetics
- Add `cursor-grab` on hover and `cursor-grabbing` while dragging.
- Give the cards a subtle dark-theme glassmorphism background, rounded corners, and a slight scale-up effect when hovered.

Provide the complete, functional component code. Ensure the velocity logic and the math for the infinite wrap are cleanly separated and commented.
