You are an expert Next.js and front-end developer specializing in Framer Motion and modern UI/UX.

Your task is to build a reusable "Fade In/Out" scroll wrapper and a smooth "Contact Form Modal" for a personal portfolio website. Do NOT use hardcoded colors (like zinc, slate, black, or white). You must use semantic Tailwind utility classes (e.g., bg-background, text-foreground, border-border) so the components inherit the global theme perfectly.

### 1. Scroll-Triggered Fade (The Wrapper)
- Create a reusable React component called `FadeInSection`.
- Use Framer Motion (`motion.div`). 
- **Animation Logic:** Set `initial={{ opacity: 0, y: 30 }}` and `whileInView={{ opacity: 1, y: 0 }}`.
- **The Stability Prop:** You MUST set `viewport={{ once: true, amount: 0.2 }}`. This ensures the section fades in smoothly the first time it enters the viewport and remains perfectly stable afterward. Include a smooth transition (`duration: 0.6, ease: "easeOut"`).

### 2. The Contact Form Modal (Click-Triggered)
- Create a `ContactModal` component managed by a boolean state (`isOpen`, `setIsOpen`).
- **Mounting Animation:** Wrap the modal in Framer Motion's `<AnimatePresence>`. 
- **The Overlay:** When open, render a full-screen fixed background (`fixed inset-0 z-50 bg-background/80 backdrop-blur-md`). It should animate from `opacity: 0` to `opacity: 1`.
- **The Form Container:** Inside the overlay, center a glassmorphism card (`bg-card/90 text-card-foreground border border-border rounded-2xl shadow-lg`). Animate it sliding slightly up and fading in (`initial={{ opacity: 0, scale: 0.95, y: 20 }}`, `animate={{ opacity: 1, scale: 1, y: 0 }}`).
- **The Close Button:** Place an absolute positioned "X" button (use a simple SVG or Lucide icon) in the top right corner of the form card. Style it to be subtle but accessible (`text-muted-foreground hover:text-foreground`). Clicking this must trigger the close state, allowing `<AnimatePresence>` to smoothly reverse the animations before unmounting.

### 3. Form UI & Styling
- Inside the modal, include a clean, minimal contact form: Name, Email, and Message inputs.
- Style the inputs with semantic Tailwind CSS: `bg-input/50`, `text-foreground`, subtle borders (`border-border`), and a focus ring (`focus:ring-2 focus:ring-ring focus:outline-none`).
- Include a sleek "Send Message" submit button using theme-appropriate button classes (e.g., `bg-primary text-primary-foreground hover:bg-primary/90`).

Provide the complete code for both components, plus an example of how to implement them together on a page (e.g., a trigger button that opens the modal, and a few dummy sections wrapped in the `FadeInSection`).
