You are an expert front-end developer specializing in modern, high-performance web animations.

Your task is to create a "Sticky Stacking Sections" scroll layout where full-screen sections stack on top of each other as the user scrolls down, much like a deck of cards.

### 1. Core Architecture & Layout
- Create a parent container holding 4 distinct sections.
- Each section must take up the full viewport height (`min-h-screen` or `h-screen`).
- Give each section a different dark-themed background color (e.g., slate-900, zinc-950, neutral-900, stone-950) so the overlapping effect is clearly visible.

### 2. The Scrolling Physics (The Magic)
- Do NOT use complex JavaScript or Framer Motion for the core stacking logic. Rely on CSS `position: sticky`.
- Apply `sticky top-0` to every section. 
- Ensure the parent container has no `overflow: hidden` properties that would break the sticky behavior.
- As the user scrolls, Section 1 should stick to the top of the screen. Section 2 should continue scrolling up in the normal document flow until it slides completely *over* Section 1, at which point Section 2 becomes sticky at `top: 0`, and so on.

### 3. Depth & Visual Polish
- To make the stacking feel realistic, add a subtle scale-down and darken effect to the section underneath.
- When Section 2 is sliding over Section 1, Section 1 should smoothly transition to a slightly darker opacity and scale down to `0.95`. 
- You can use Framer Motion's `useScroll` and `useTransform` hooks mapped to the window's scroll position strictly to handle this subtle scaling/darkening effect in the background, but the actual pinning must remain CSS-based for performance.

### 4. Tech Stack & Styling
- Framework: Next.js.
- Styling: Tailwind CSS.
- Assets: Include some placeholder typography (large headings) and a simple grid layout inside each section so they don't look empty.

Please provide the complete, functional component code. Ensure the scrolling feels native, smooth, and works infinitely in both directions without glitching.
