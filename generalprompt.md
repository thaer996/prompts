You are an expert professional full-stack website developer. Build me a premium, modern, fully responsive website. Depending on the project requirements, you may use modern frameworks and libraries such as React, Next.js, TypeScript, and Three.js, or use vanilla HTML/CSS/JS if specifically requested.

GENERAL GOAL
Create a high-end, polished, premium-quality website structure that I can reuse for different projects. I will provide the section names, navbar items, inspiration images, and additional animations when needed. The website must feel smooth, modern, elegant, and professional.

CORE REQUIREMENTS

RESPONSIVENESS & FLUID LAYOUT
• The website must be 100% fluid and fully responsive across absolutely ALL screen sizes:
  - Ultrawide monitors
  - Standard Desktops & Laptops
  - Tablets (Portrait and Landscape)
  - All Mobile devices (including small screens)
• Prevent ALL horizontal overflow using:
  - `box-sizing: border-box;` globally.
  - `overflow-x: hidden;` on the main wrapper/body.
• Use fluid layouts (Flexbox, CSS Grid, or Tailwind/CSS equivalents). DO NOT use rigid fixed widths; use responsive units (%, vw, vh, rem) and max-width containers.
• Ensure proper left and right padding/margins on all screen sizes so content never touches the screen edges.

RESPONSIVE MEDIA & IMAGES (CRITICAL)
• All images, videos, 3D canvases (Three.js), and media MUST be strictly responsive.
• Apply `max-width: 100%;` and `height: auto;` globally to images so they scale down effortlessly.
• Images must never be half-shown, clipped awkwardly, or stretch outside their containers.
• Use `object-fit: cover;` or `object-fit: contain;` where appropriate to maintain perfect aspect ratios without distortion.

STICKY & RESPONSIVE NAVBAR
• Create a sticky/fixed navbar at the top that is perfectly responsive across ALL breakpoints.
• Navbar must smoothly transition when scrolling (e.g., Background color transition, Glassmorphism blur effect).
• Navbar must include:
  - Logo placeholder (responsive size).
  - Navigation links.
  - Mobile hamburger menu.
• Desktop/Tablet behavior: Trigger the mobile menu before the navigation links collide with the logo on medium-sized screens (like iPads) to prevent layout breaks.
• Mobile menu requirements: Smooth open/close animation, no layout shifting, clean full-screen or slide-out design.
• Highlight the active section while scrolling.

SMOOTH SCROLLING
• Enable smooth scrolling across the entire website.
• All anchor links must scroll smoothly to their target sections, accounting for the height of the sticky navbar (e.g., using `scroll-padding-top`).

HOVER EFFECTS
• Apply premium, subtle hover effects to Buttons, Cards, Images, Navbar links, and Icons.
• Effects may include: Smooth color transitions, subtle scaling, elevation (translateY), shadow transitions, and opacity changes.
• Effects must be elegant, professional, and not excessive. Use proper transition timings.

SCROLL-TRIGGERED REVEAL ANIMATIONS
• Implement scroll-triggered animations (using Intersection Observer in vanilla JS, or libraries like Framer Motion if using React/Next.js).
• When elements enter the viewport, animate them using opacity transitions (fade in), vertical motion (translateY), and smooth easing.
• Animations must be high-performance, fast, and not laggy.
• Animations MUST NOT break the layout or cause horizontal overflow (apply hidden overflow to parent containers if translating elements from the side).

COLOR SYSTEM & STYLING
• Extract the dominant color palette and visual mood from my instructions.
• Apply colors consistently using CSS Variables, Tailwind config, or styled-components.
• Maintain a professional, accessible, and harmonious color contrast across backgrounds, text, buttons, and hover states.

TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS
• Architecture: Use a clean, modular, component-based architecture (especially if using React/Next.js).
• TypeScript (If used): Ensure strict typing, well-defined interfaces/types for all props and state.
• CSS: Use modern CSS3, CSS Modules, or Tailwind CSS (whichever fits the stack best).
• 3D/Canvas (If used): If utilizing Three.js/React Three Fiber, ensure the canvas is responsive, gracefully degrades on low-end devices, and resizes properly on window resize events.
• Ensure no console errors, semantic HTML tags, and production-level code quality.

DELIVERABLES
Provide the complete, robust code for the requested structure. If using a framework like Next.js, provide the code divided clearly by files/components (e.g., Navbar component, Hero component, Layout file) so I can easily copy and paste them into my project directory.
